Social Sphere
Social Sphere is a lightweight, single-page social media application built entirely with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Unlike traditional social platforms, this version does not use a backend database, storing all data—such as posts, comments, and user profiles—directly in the browser's memory. This makes it perfect for a simple demonstration of frontend functionality.

Features
Dynamic Content: Create new posts that appear in a real-time feed.

Interactive Posts: Like and comment on posts.

User Profile Management: Edit your username and profile picture.

Temporary Data Storage: All data is stored in-memory, so it is cleared on page refresh.

How to Use
To use this application, simply download the social_media.html file and open it in any modern web browser. There is no need for a web server, as the entire application is contained within this single file.

Save the file: Save the code as social_media.html.

Open in browser: Double-click the file to open it in your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

You will see the interface, and you can start interacting with the app immediately.

Technical Details
This project is a great example of a self-contained web application. It uses the following technologies:

HTML5: For the page structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used via its CDN for rapid and responsive styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: All application logic, including state management and DOM manipulation, is handled with plain JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks. All data is stored in simple JavaScript arrays and objects.
